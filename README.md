### Functions 

 A **function** in JavaScript is similar to a recipe—a set of instructions that perform a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. 
   * To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
   * Helps eliminate writing multiple lines.
   * Block of code to perform task.
   * Is executed when it is `called` 

### Variables

**Variables** can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.
   * Global ***variables*** have a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.
   * Local ***variables*** will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.
   * Names are case sensitive. 

### Git Together 
 
   * This week I learned how to collaborate on the same repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/git-together)
