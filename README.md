### Functions 

 A **function** in JavaScript is similar to a recipe—a set of instructions that perform a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. 
   * To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
   * Helps eliminate writing multiple lines.
   * Block of code to perform task.
   * Is executed when it is "called"
